Ban spies forever.

And ruin the annoying Digital Marketing evil part.

In this article, you will see:

- how to easily achieve mostly free browsing
- why you should do this
- how to achieve perfect anonymity

## 1. Ban spies in 30 sec

### Change your default browser

For some, internet is the browser. But it isn't.

> Internet is the roads, your Browser is your car.
>
> And the roads are full of cameras.

And with different cars come different ways to ride! Some want to drive a red Ferrari that everyone can see and track.

But you may want to hide your license plate while keeping a luxurious and ergonomic interior.

That's what we'll do.

Install the **Firefox** browser ([desktop](https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/new/)) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/navigateur-web-firefox/id989804926)) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox)).

This will help you in many ways _without_ changing your browsing experience. It is not different of Chrome, Edge or Safari even in terms of speed or RAM usage.

Why it is not more installed then ?

Easy answer. Of course, Google will install its Chrome into its Android products. And it's the same for Microsoft and Edge installed by default on Windows or Apple with Safari on their iOS.

### Install some extensions

Install Privacy Badger on your Firefox browser. Even for smartphones, Firefox handles extensions perfectly well!

### Use a different search engine

> "Search it on Google!" "Just Google it!"

Google IS internet search.

## 3. For nerds: you can go further.

### Change the OS

But the internet is Use linux.

### Use TOR

What is Tor ?

### Deactivate JavaScript

I know you're smiling.

> Now the Internet relies on Javascript. You can't just get rid of it.

Oh, don't worry. We will not get rid of it entirely. Some are necessary, some are evil or dangerous (even unintentionally!).

What should I keep?

- First-party scripts. They are often necessary (but not always: in this blog, it is optional!)
- Static content providers. They are mostly harmless and provide content like images and fonts.
- Some CDN (Content delivery network).

What should you delete?

- Trackers
- All unknown or useless scripts

The [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/noscript/) extension for Firefox handle the management of scripts perfectly. Moreover, it will protect you from many others JavaScripts flaws.

> But it's hard work! I don't wanna bother about it...

I've prepared a blacklist/whitelist that you can import in seconds.

Enjoy!
